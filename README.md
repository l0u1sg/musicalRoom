# A little explanation about the project

## The idea
It all started from an observation, to be able to let my guests choose certain music to play during the evening. The problem is that you have to pass your phone, sometimes a wrong manipulation and the music stops, in short it is not practical ðŸ˜¬


## The solution
I started by looking on the internet if collaborative queues didn't already exist. I couldn't find anything so I decided to create my own project to solve my problem. 


## How the future project will work

Here is how I imagine the project to work, first of all everything would happen on a website, accessible from everywhere (mobile, tablet, computer, etc.), to start with, the user would have to connect with the music service of his choice on which he has a subscription allowing him to stream music. Then they would create a room, which would be a unique link protected by a random 4 or 6 digit password. People wanting to add music to the queue would simply log into the link, enter the code and then choose the music they want to add to the queue. All this without any connection.


## The problem

There is only one problem with this big project, and that is that I really don't know where to start, or how to do it. I have a pretty good knowledge in development, but I really don't know where to start. That's why I need your help ðŸ‘Š You'll find the To-Do list at the bottom, and in the Issues tab the different discussions about the technologies we could use!
Of course any participation in the development of the project will be marked in the credits of the repo and the site!

# To-do
Here is a non-exhaustive list of things to do to get this project underway
 - [ ] Create the site
 - [ ] Database
 - [ ] API to fetch music (Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer etc...)
 - [ ] Securing the project (password to access a room)

# Collaboration
In order to be able to work together in the best conditions, here are a few points to consider. 

 - Pull requests must be clear and precise
 - All commits must respect the [conventional commit] rule (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) 
 (TIP: use the Conventional commits extension on VSCode)
 - Issues must be complete and detailed 
 - Have fun!
